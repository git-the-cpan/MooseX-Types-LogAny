SYNOPSIS

            use Moose;
            use Class::Load 0.20 'load_class';
            use MooseX::Types::LogAny qw( LogAny );
    
            has log => (
                    isa     => LogAny,
                    is      => 'ro',
                    lazy    => 1,
                    default => sub { load_class('Log::Any')->get_logger },
            );

DESCRIPTION

    This module is no longer recommended, the reason for its existence has
    been resolved in recent versions of Log::Any see it's documentation for
    how to use Log::Any with Moose.

    The motivation behind this modules is that Log::Any::Adapter::Null does
    not inherit from Log::Any::Adapter::Base which all of the other
    adapters do. Moose will not allow a type union of undefined types
    unless they are Moose classes. This module allows you to simply use the
    LogAny type which has done the union for you.

    Type union of LogAnyNull and LogAnyBase

    Class Log::Any::Adapter::Null

    Class Log::Any::Adapter::Base

    Class Log::Any::Proxy
